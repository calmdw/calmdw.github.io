I am the research assitant at [Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om-sdu/institutter-centre/mmmi_maersk_mckinney_moeller), University of Southern Denmark. My research focus on reinforcement learning and robotic assembly. Before that, I have several interships on [AI center, CVUT](https://www.aic.fel.cvut.cz/), [TAMS, Universit√§t Hamburg](https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/) and DTU Aqua. 

I graduated from Autonomous System master program at [Denmark Technical University](https://www.dtu.dk/english/).
