Hej! I am the research assitant at [Maersk Mc-Kinney Moller Institute](https://www.sdu.dk/en/om-sdu/institutter-centre/mmmi_maersk_mckinney_moeller), University of Southern Denmark. Before that, I have several interships on [AI center, CVUT](https://www.aic.fel.cvut.cz/), [TAMS, Universit√§t Hamburg](https://tams.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/) and DTU Aqua. I graduated from Autonomous System master program at [Denmark Technical University](https://www.dtu.dk/english/).

My research focus on robot learning and robotic manipulation. Recently I am using using reinforcement learning methods to achieve generalizable and high-precision robotic assembly and IsaacLab(IsaacSim) is my current favorite RL frame and simulator.

Welcome for small chat about reinforcement learning, imitation learning and sim2real.
